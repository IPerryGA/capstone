# capstone
Capstone project for GA
My Capstone involved taking data from Youtube of the top 300 keywords for Documentaries.  I was to clean, analyse and parse the data.  My modelling involved two steps,  using regression to predict views adn using NLTK to identify the words popular in the title and description box.
